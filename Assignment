20.Given an array of integer , write a program to check whether an Arithmetic progression can be formed or not

For example:

    The given array is: 23,3,18,13,8

    The output is : YES

Explanation:

    Rearrange the array 3,8,13,18,23 which forms the A.p



 Input Format:

     The first line has the size of the array

     Second line contains the elements of the array.

Constraints:

    1 <= N <= 10^5

    1 <= arr[i] <= 10^9

Output Format:

    print Yes or No

Sample Input:

    5

    23 3 18 13 8

Sample Output:

    Yes


21.1,11,21,1211,111221,312211,?print the pattern
